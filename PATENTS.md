# PATENTS & PROPRIETARY RIGHTS POLICY v2.1  
_Last updated 2025‑05‑10_

---

## 0 Purpose & Scope  
This notice secures the **PhantomInterface Collective (“PIC”)** dental‑regeneration
innovations through a layered IP strategy that combines **defensive publication,
trade‑secret protection, copyright, patents, and unfair‑competition law**.
Commercial actors must obtain a separate, written licence.

## 1 Defensive Publication & Prior Art  

| Disclosure Channel | Timestamp | Persistent ID |
|--------------------|-----------|---------------|
| GitHub Repository | 2025‑04‑23 | <https://github.com/phatominterfac/teeth-that-will-not-fail> |
| YouTube Timestamp Demo | 2025‑04‑23 | <https://youtu.be/SaER7-QNF-k> |
| Zenodo Archive | 2025‑05‑04 | DOI 10.5281/zenodo.15336594 |

These disclosures constitute **absolute prior art** under 35 U.S.C. § 102(b),
Art 54 EPC, and equivalent statutes worldwide.  Any later patent application
covering identical or obvious variants of these methods **lacks novelty** and
is subject to invalidation.

---

## 2 Trade‑Secret Portfolio (Confidential)  

Until formal patent filings are lodged, PIC treats the following elements as
**trade secrets** under the Swiss UCA Art 162 and EU Directive 2016/943:

| Code‑Name | Confidential Mechanism / Rationale |
|-----------|------------------------------------|
| **CR‑SOC Loop** | Real‑time biosensor lattice enforcing **K ≈ 1** criticality to stabilise regenerative dynamics (Phase III). |
| **C9‑VASC‑Guard** | Inducible caspase‑9 switch in engineered endothelial progenitors to abort malignant angiogenesis. |

By accessing this repository you agree **not** to:  
1. Reverse‑engineer or de‑compile these mechanisms for commercial gain.  
2. Disclose technical details without PIC’s written consent.  
3. File patent applications covering substantially similar technology.  

Breaching this section triggers **liquidated damages** per `LICENSE.md § 6`
(€250 000 intentional / €50 000 negligent) plus injunctive relief.

## 3 Copyright & Licence  

All text, code, diagrams, and CAD assets are © 2025 PhantomInterface Collective
and released under the **PhantomInterface Non‑Commercial Attribution Licence v2.1**.  
- **Commercial or military use is prohibited** without a separate agreement.  
- Attribution is mandatory for any non‑commercial derivative works.  
See `LICENSE.md` for binding terms.

---

## 4 Patent‑Filing Strategy & No‑Challenge Clause  

PIC reserves the right to pursue **offensive or defensive patent protection**
for any element of this technology at its discretion.

Contributors and downstream users **agree not to challenge** (or assist any
third party in challenging) the validity or enforceability of any current or
future PIC patent related to this project (see `CLA.md § 2`).

## 5 Enforcement & Remedies  

| Violation | Primary Remedy | Statutory Basis |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| Trade‑secret misappropriation | Injunction + compensatory & punitive damages | Swiss SCC Art 273; EU Directive 2016/943 |
| Patented‑method infringement | Injunction + disgorgement + damages | Swiss PatA Art 66; EPC Art 64 |
| Unauthorised commercial use | Liquidated damages (€250 k / €50 k) + account takedown | `LICENSE.md § 6`; DMCA § 512 |
| Patent or IP challenge by contributor | Automatic CLA breach + injunctive relief | `CLA.md § 2` |

Prevailing party is entitled to **attorneys’ fees and expert costs**.

---

## 6 Jurisdiction & Venue  

All disputes are governed by substantive **Swiss law** and adjudicated
exclusively in the **Zürich Commercial Court** (first instance) per
[`JURISDICTION.md`](./JURISDICTION.md).

---

## 7 Export‑Control Warning  

Export or re‑export of these technologies may require authorisation under
Swiss / EU dual‑use regulations (e.g., EC Reg 2021/821).  See
[`EXPORT_CONTROL.md`](./EXPORT_CONTROL.md).
