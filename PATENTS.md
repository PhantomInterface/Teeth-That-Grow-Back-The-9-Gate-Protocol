# PATENTS & PROPRIETARY RIGHTS POLICY v2.2  
**Last updated:** 2025-05-10  

---

## 0. Purpose & Scope  
This notice secures all **PhantomInterface Collective (PIC)** dental-regeneration innovations—including the **Nine-Gate Regenerative Protocol v2.0**—through a layered IP strategy combining:

- Defensive publication  
- Trade-secret protection  
- Copyright  
- Patent strategy  
- Unfair-competition law  

> **Future Versions Clause:**  
> This policy applies to all **current and future versions** of the protocol, including updates, iterations, or improvements. Any subsequent versions will be covered under the same legal framework unless explicitly revised.

**Any commercial use requires a separate, written licence from PIC.**

---

## 1. Defensive Publication & Prior Art  
These disclosures establish **absolute prior art** under **35 U.S.C. § 102(b), Art 54 EPC**, and equivalent statutes worldwide. Any later patent covering identical or obvious variants is **presumptively invalid**.

| Disclosure Channel      | Timestamp  | Persistent ID                                                             |

> **Note:** All disclosures now include **v2.0 features** (endocrine regulation, microbiome stabilization, merged neuro-vascular gate, upgraded digital twin sensors).

---

## 2. Trade-Secret Portfolio (Confidential)  
Until formal patent filings are lodged, PIC treats the following elements as **trade secrets** under **Swiss UCA Art 162** and **EU Directive 2016/943**. Unauthorized reverse-engineering, disclosure, or patent filings covering these mechanisms is strictly prohibited:

| Code-Name         | Confidential Mechanism / Rationale                                                                 |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **CR-SOC Loop**     | Real-time biosensor lattice enforcing **K ≈ 1** criticality to stabilize regenerative dynamics (Phase III).   |
| **C9-VASC-Guard**   | Inducible caspase-9 switch in engineered endothelial progenitors to **abort malignant angiogenesis**.       |
| **C7-ANABO-PRIME**  | HDAC-i micro-pulse + endocrine modulation (PTH + dCas9-TET1) for **epigenetic anabolic priming**.               |
| **C8-BIO-RECODE**   | Synbiotic rinse (Bifidobacterium/Prevotella + arginine/glycine buffer) for **oral biofilm re-programming**.    |

**By accessing this repository you agree not to:**  
1. Reverse-engineer or de-compile these mechanisms for commercial gain.  
2. Disclose technical details without PIC’s written consent.  
3. File patent applications covering substantially similar technology.

_Breaching this section triggers liquidated damages per LICENSE.md § 6 (€250 000 intentional / €50 000 negligent) plus injunctive relief._

## 3. Copyright & Licence  
All text, code, diagrams, CAD assets, and protocol definitions (including v2.0) are © 2025 PhantomInterface Collective and released under the **PhantomInterface Non-Commercial Attribution Licence v2.1**.

- **Commercial or military use is prohibited** without a separate agreement.  
- **Attribution** is mandatory for any non-commercial derivative works.

## 4. Patent-Filing Strategy & No-Challenge Clause  
PIC reserves the right to pursue **offensive or defensive patent protection** for any element of this technology—including all **v2.0 innovations**—at its discretion.

> **No-Challenge Clause:**  
> Contributors and downstream users agree not to **challenge** (or assist any third party in challenging) the validity or enforceability of any current or future PIC patent related to this project (see **CLA.md § 2**).

| Unauthorized commercial use         | Liquidated damages (€250 k / €50 k) + account takedown | LICENSE.md § 6; DMCA § 512            |
| Patent or IP challenge by contributor | Automatic CLA breach + injunctive relief         | CLA.md § 2                               |

_Prevailing party is entitled to attorneys’ fees and expert costs._
