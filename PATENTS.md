PATENTS & PROPRIETARY RIGHTS POLICY v2.2

Last updated 2025‑05‑10

⸻

0 Purpose & Scope

This notice secures all PhantomInterface Collective (“PIC”) dental-regeneration innovations—including Nine-Gate Regenerative Protocol v2.0—through a layered IP strategy that combines:
	•	Defensive publication
	•	Trade-secret protection
	•	Copyright
	•	Patent strategy
	•	Unfair-competition law

Future Versions Clause:
This policy applies to all current and future versions of the protocol, including updates, iterations, or improvements. Any subsequent versions will be covered under the same legal framework unless explicitly revised.

Any commercial use requires a separate, written licence from PIC.

⸻

1 Defensive Publication & Prior Art

These disclosures establish absolute prior art under 35 U.S.C. § 102(b), Art 54 EPC, and equivalent statutes worldwide. Any later patent covering identical or obvious variants is presumptively invalid.

Disclosure Channel	Timestamp	Persistent ID
GitHub Repository	2025‑04‑23	GitHub Link
YouTube Timestamp Demo	2025‑04‑23	YouTube Link
Zenodo Archive	2025‑05‑04	DOI 10.5281/zenodo.15336594

Note: All disclosures now reflect the inclusion of v2.0 features (systemic endocrine regulation, microbiome stabilization, merged neuro-vascular gate, and upgraded digital twin sensors).

2 Trade‑Secret Portfolio (Confidential)

Until formal patent filings are lodged, PIC treats the following elements as trade secrets under Swiss UCA Art 162 and EU Directive 2016/943. Any unauthorized reverse engineering, disclosure, or patent filings covering these mechanisms is strictly prohibited:

Code‑Name	Confidential Mechanism / Rationale
CR‑SOC Loop	Real‑time biosensor lattice enforcing K ≈ 1 criticality to stabilize regenerative dynamics (Phase III).
C9‑VASC‑Guard	Inducible caspase-9 switch in engineered endothelial progenitors to abort malignant angiogenesis.
C7-ANABO-PRIME	HDAC-i micro-pulse and endocrine modulation protocols (PTH + dCas9-TET1) for epigenetic anabolic priming.
C8-BIO-RECODE	Synbiotic rinse formulation (Bifidobacterium/Prevotella + arginine/glycine buffer) for oral biofilm re-programming.

Usage Restrictions:

By accessing this repository, you agree not to:
	1.	Reverse-engineer or de-compile these mechanisms for commercial gain.
	2.	Disclose technical details without PIC’s written consent.
	3.	File patent applications covering substantially similar technology.

Breaching this section triggers liquidated damages per LICENSE.md § 6 (€250 000 intentional / €50 000 negligent) plus injunctive relief.

3 Copyright & Licence

All text, code, diagrams, CAD assets, and protocol definitions (including v2.0) are © 2025 PhantomInterface Collective and released under the PhantomInterface Non‑Commercial Attribution Licence v2.1.
	•	Commercial or military use is prohibited without a separate agreement.
	•	Attribution is mandatory for any non-commercial derivative works.
	•	See LICENSE.md for binding terms.

⸻

4 Patent‑Filing Strategy & No‑Challenge Clause

PIC reserves the right to pursue offensive or defensive patent protection for any element of this technology—including all v2.0 innovations—at its discretion.
	•	No-Challenge Clause:
Contributors and downstream users agree not to challenge (or assist any third party in challenging) the validity or enforceability of any current or future PIC patent related to this project (see CLA.md § 2).

5 Enforcement & Remedies

Violation	Primary Remedy	Statutory Basis
Trade‑secret misappropriation	Injunction + compensatory & punitive damages	Swiss SCC Art 273; EU Directive 2016/943
Patented‑method infringement	Injunction + disgorgement + damages	Swiss PatA Art 66; EPC Art 64
Unauthorised commercial use	Liquidated damages (€250 k / €50 k) + account takedown	LICENSE.md § 6; DMCA § 512
Patent or IP challenge by contributor	Automatic CLA breach + injunctive relief	CLA.md § 2

Prevailing party is entitled to attorneys’ fees and expert costs.

⸻

6 Jurisdiction & Venue

All disputes are governed by substantive Swiss law and adjudicated exclusively in the Zürich Commercial Court (first instance) per JURISDICTION.md.

⸻

7 Export‑Control Warning

Export or re‑export of these technologies may require authorization under Swiss / EU dual‑use regulations (e.g., EC Reg 2021/821). See EXPORT_CONTROL.md.
