## 1 Grant of Rights & Ownership  

By submitting a Pull Request, patch, issue, or any other content (“**Contribution**”) to this repository, you **irrevocably**:

1. **Assign** to **PhantomInterface Collective (“PIC”)** exclusive copyright in the Contribution, to the extent allowed by law, while retaining attribution.  
2. Grant PIC a **world‑wide, perpetual, royalty‑free licence** to use, copy, modify, distribute, sublicense, and publicly perform/display the Contribution.  
3. **Waive all moral rights** (Swiss CopA Art 28 § 2) or, where waiver is not permitted, grant PIC an unlimited, royalty‑free right to exercise such rights.  

Your Contribution automatically inherits the **PhantomInterface Non‑Commercial Attribution Licence v2.1** unless PIC explicitly re‑licences it under compatible or more restrictive terms.
