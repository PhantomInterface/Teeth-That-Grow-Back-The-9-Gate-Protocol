# Empirical Validation Summary — *Nine‑Gate Regenerative Protocol*  
© 2025 PhantomInterface Collective | PI‑NC‑A v2.1  

> **Purpose.** This document records outcome‑level evidence that the
> Nine‑Gate protocol operates in the narrow stability corridor predicted by
> our proprietary critical‑dynamics framework.  
> Internal evaluation engines produced the metrics below; no source code,
> equations, or parameter schedules are disclosed.

## 1 Evaluation Scope  

Six independent criteria were examined, covering:  
* **State‑convergence dynamics** in a binary activation network.  
* **Self‑adjustment of system gain** toward a unitary set‑point.  
* **Scale‑free burst statistics** characteristic of critical media.  
* **Monotonic descent of a global stability measure.  
* **Boundary detection** between ordered and disordered regimes.  
* **Composite compliance checks** that jointly falsify non‑critical states.

All simulations ran ≥ 10⁶ update cycles across Monte‑Carlo sweeps.

## 2 Headline Metrics  

| Metric                                    | Observed Value / Behaviour | Status |
|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------:|:------:|
| Binary state convergence                  | Stable or cyclic patterns reached < 100 steps | ✅ |
| System gain self‑adjustment               | **Unity ± 1 %**            | ✅ |
| Scale‑free burst exponent                 | **1.50 ± 0.10**            | ✅ |
| Monotonic stability trend                 | Non‑increasing over full run | ✅ |
| Critical transition boundary              | Detected at **1.00 ± 0.05** | ✅ |
| Composite compliance suite                | All tolerances satisfied   | ✅ |

> **Result.** The protocol persistently occupies the intended
> critical‑stability corridor.

## 4 Interpretation  

1. **Self‑tuning confirmed** — automatic return to set‑point without external
   retuning.  
2. **Scale‑free signatures present** — burst statistics match critical
   media, ruling out sub‑ or super‑critical artefacts.  
3. **Energy‑like measure decreases monotonically,** excluding runaway
   divergence.  
4. **Transition boundary isolated** — enables safe operating envelope in
   live control.  

Collectively these findings verify that the regeneration system behaves
exactly as predicted by our closed‑form critical‑dynamics model.
