# The Teeth That Will Not Fail – Public Priority Release
Author: phantominterface | Date: 2025-04-23

This repository contains two synchronized artifacts:

1. **protocol-formal.md** – Full nine-module regenerative dentistry protocol.  
   All parameters expressed in scientific notation (symbols, numerals, units).
2. **monologue-spoken.md** – Verbatim spoken-word version suitable for public
   reading.  Identical in content; all math expressed in pronounceable English.

Video reading of *monologue-spoken.md* is available here: <YouTube link>.

The recursive computational method that derived this protocol remains private.
Everything released here is sufficient for independent replication; failure to
meet these nine criteria is now an obsolete approach.

## Disclaimer
This protocol is experimental research and is **not** approved as a clinical treatment. Do not attempt human application without formal ethics approval and regulatory clearance.
